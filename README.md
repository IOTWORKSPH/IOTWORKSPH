# Hi there, I'm Ronald Alvarez 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Technology Convergence at **Handong Global University, Pohang, South Korea** under the KOICA Scholarship Program. My academic journey is complemented by a deep passion for technology, especially in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT).

## 🔭 Current Work:
I'm working on my thesis project titled **"Code-Free, Dual Mode Customized Internet of Things Web Applications."** This project aims to simplify the process of creating IoT web applications without needing to write a single line of code. The dual-mode functionality allows for greater flexibility, making it easier for users to develop and deploy IoT solutions.

## 🌱 Learning and Growing:
As part of my research, I’m delving into various aspects of IoT, cloud computing, and web application development. I'm constantly learning about the latest trends and technologies in these fields to make my project more robust and user-friendly.

## 🤝 Collaboration Opportunities:
I’m looking for assistance in deploying my web applications online to test their functionality and identify any potential limitations. If you have experience with cloud deployment, web hosting, or IoT, I'd love to collaborate with you!
